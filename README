googleCard
====================

Scrape data about a user from Google+.

This project used to be "A very quick and rough PHP class to scrape data
from google+" but is now a procedural codebase with a minimalist PHP class
wrapper (for existing users, and all those poor, poor, OO PHP enthusiasts
out there... ;) and a bunch of bugfixes / improvements.

Example:
 - See index.php for a sample implementation (OO)

Requirements
---------------------
 - PHP with 'curl' and 'json' support compiled in (should be...)
 - A writable cache directory, if you want to use caching (just say yes!)

Installation
---------------------
 - The code should make its own cache directory if it has
   rights, otherwise you may need to do this manually.

Compatibility
---------------------
 - "Should" work on Windows as well as Unix platforms, however this is
   untested

Usage
---------------------
Basically it comes down to one function. You supply it with a Google+
ID and it returns an array of information regarding that user. The 
information returned is as follows:

      'url'      URL to the user's Google+ profile
      'img'      URL to the user's Google+ profile image
      'count'    Total number of followers the user has
      'name'     The user's name

The interface differs slightly based upon your implementation style.

 Procedural ("Traditional / Unix style")
 ---------------------------------------
  require_once('gc.php');
  $googleplusid = '123456789012345678901';
  $info = google_plus_user_info($googleplusid);
  print $info['name'] . ' has ' . $info['count'] . ' followers.';

 Object Oriented ("Enterprise Platform Framework Integration style")*
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
  include_once('googleCard.php');
  $googleplusid = '123456789012345678901';
  $plus = new googleCard($plus_id);
  $data = $plus->googleCard();
  print $data['name'] . ' has ' . $data['count'] . ' followers.';

   * Also, usually a hell of a lot more typing, less concise code,
     more implicit assumptions about integration paths, etc. See
     'Coders at Work' or 'The Art of UNIX Programming' for some
     well-considered and even-handed criticisms of OO's overuse.

Configuration
-------------
There are some options available within the source, however you
are encouraged to use the defaults.
